ArmA3 PvP scenario

## background

OPFOR holds the sea to the east of Stratis. BLUFOR holds the island proper. 

During a recent engagement, OPFOR lost a supply ship carrying a rather special weapon. 
There is reason to be believe, though, that a crate containing the item has been washed up on Stratis.

## objectives

### OPFOR

OPFOR must retrieve some weapon from a crate that is supposed to be at a beach on Stratis, and extract it back to the OPFOR dominated sea to the east.

#### Intel

The coast is believed to be guarded but lightly by BLUFOR. Inland incursions should be avoided, as they will likely provoke a rather harsh reaction.

There is a backup attack boat hidden on the beach north of the objective.

### BLUFOR

BLUFOR dominates the island. BLUFOR must prevent OPFOR from finding and escaping with said weapon.

#### Intel

The waters to the east of the island harbor OPFOR forces. It is advised not to venture too far from the island.

We believe that whatever OPFOR is looking for to be visible when carried.


## TODO


* if the launcher is spawning it, and you're unable to carry the RPG, spawn it on the ground. or, find a method to force-load the launcher
